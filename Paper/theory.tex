\subsection{Plane parallel layer}
The investigated semiconductor samples can in first approximation be described as a plane parallel 
layer \ref{fig:fabry-perot-illustration} with a thickness $d$ and refractive index $N_2$ which acts like a fabry-perot interferometer.

The incoming light is described by a ray which is denoted with a 0. Then every reflection at the first 
interface is denoted with a dash
